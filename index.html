        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            I plan on creating an AI assistant inspired by the fictional AI JARVIS. Dubbed M.A.V.I.S (My Average Very Intelligent System), this project will either be developed as a dedicated website or a mobile phone application. M.A.V.I.S will integrate text-to-speech capabilities and display waveform audio visualizations, offering users a visually engaging and interactive experience. The system is designed to respond dynamically to voice commands, reminiscent of the futuristic interfaces seen in popular culture.
            The underlying architecture utalizes a pipeline that begins with speech-to-text processing to capture the user's voice. Once transcribed, the text is fed into a large language model that has been fine-tuned to act as a virtual assistant, generating intelligent and context-aware responses. These responses are then converted back into spoken word using a text-to-speech engine, while the output is simultaneously visualized on-screen as a waveform pattern. This comprehensive approach aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interaction that mirrors the capabilities of advanced AI systems portrayed in fiction.
